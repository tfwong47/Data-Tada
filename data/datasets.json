While measurements are collected at a campus\nlevel, this dataset aggregates data geographically by Local Government Area\n(LGA). This aggregation not only ensures that individual schools remain\nunidentified, but also presents a summary of overall electricity usage within\nparticular geographic localities. In addition, median usage is presented\ninstead of average (mean) values to account for extreme levels of consumption\nthat can give a skewed indication of overall LGA usage.\nWhile there are figures for nearly all LGAs there are some for which no values\nare shown. This may be due to insufficient or non-available data, or to ensure\nconfidentiality of individual schools in LGAs with a small number of schools.",

    "description": "The On Track Survey is conducted in April to mid-July of Victorian school leavers who completed Year 12 or equivalent in the previous year and who agreed to participate in the survey. \nThe On Track survey seeks to: \nOffer a consistent and comprehensive approach to monitoring the transitions of school leavers; \nReport the information to schools, TAFE institutions and other education providers, organisations concerned with assisting young people, policy makers, parents and students; \nProvide detailed analysis of the transitions experienced by different groups of leavers; \nEnable education providers to use the findings to monitor and improve their programs; and \nProvide a referral service for school leavers who appear to be experiencing difficulties in the transition process.\nOn Track survey data is based on the number of students who responded to the 2020 On Track survey. This is a proportion of those who consented to participate in the On Track survey within the school.\nMoreover, the information about the survey as well as the annual results (current and historical) are also available from DET website (https://www.education.vic.gov.au/about/research/Pages/ontrack.aspx), where the datasets are listed and available in the Data and reports &gt; Year 12 completers summary section.",

This aggregation not only ensures that individual schools remain\nunidentified, but also presents a summary of overall natural gas usage within\nparticular geographic localities. In addition, median usage is presented\ninstead of average (mean) values to account for extreme levels of consumption\nthat can give a skewed indication of overall LGA usage.\nIt is important to note that in this dataset not all LGAs have figures against\nthem: this may be due to insufficient or non-available data (for instance, not\nall schools use natural gas); or in the case where LGAs have a smaller number\nof schools, data may be left out to ensure individual schools or campuses are\nnot identified.",

    "description": "A dataset of enrolments (FTE) of all schools in Victoria, based on collections from the February 2022 schools census, including Government and non-Government Schools (Catholic and Independent schools).\nInformation collected from the February school census of Victorian schools: For each school, Full Time Equivalent (FTE) enrolments by school type and year level are included. A student who is full-time to school education will be counted as 1.0 FTE. This includes a student who may be shared across two schools (e.g. 0.8 FTE at one school and 0.2 FTE at another school). Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2022 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:\n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2022 February School Census results but this value is currently under-represented.\n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems to risk of possible identification as too high for publication.",

Students who are part-time to school education will be counted based on the workload for which they have enrolled. In primary year levels, the workload is generally based on the time they attend school while the number of subjects is used for students in secondary year levels.\nFor this 2023 census year data, the students' sex/gender category is not included for the following reasons:                       \n•   The gender of 'self-described' was implemented at the beginning of 2022 for Victorian government schools. Enrolments with this gender value are collected in the 2023 February School Census results but this value is currently under represented.      \n•   Due to the small numbers of enrolments with the 'self-described' gender, there is the potential for individuals to be identifiable at the school and year level.\n•   The 'self-described' counts are in their infancy and will likely increase over time but at this stage the department deems the risk of possible identification as too high.",

    "title": "Victorian Government School Zones 2024",
    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian student has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student’s choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the child’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "A dataset of schools apparent retention rates or ARR, all school sector in Victoria, from census year 2012 to 2023.\nThis dataset is prepared and based on data collected from schools as part of the February School Census conducted on the last school day of February each year. It presents information for all government and non-government schools and student enrolments in Victoria, in particular secondary school years. The majority of the statistical data in this publication is drawn from school administration systems. The dataset includes analysis by school sector and sex, Koorie status, as well as on government schools by region.\nApparent retention rates (ARR) are calculated based on aggregate enrolment data and provide an indicative measurement of student engagement in secondary education. The Department of Education and Training (DET) computes and publishes ARR data at a state-wide and DET region level only.\nThe term \"apparent\" retention rate reflects that retention rates are influenced by factors not taken into account by this measure such as: Student repeating year levels, Interstate and overseas migration, Transfer of students between education sectors or schools, Student who have left school previously, returning to continue their school education.\nThe ARR for year 7 to 12 (ARR 7-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 7 enrolment five years earlier. The ARR for year 10 to 12 (ARR 10-12) refers to the Year 12 enrolment expressed as a proportion of the Year 10 enrolment two years earlier.\nPlease note that the ABS calculates apparent retention using the number of full-time school students only whereas at the DET we use the number of full-time equivalent school enrolments. Data reported in the ABS Schools, Australia collection is based on enrolment data collected in August by all jurisdictions.\nThe Department has found that computing ARR at geographical areas smaller than DET regions (e.g. LGA, Postcode) can produce erratic and misleading results that are difficult to interpret or make use of. In small populations, relatively small changes in student numbers can create large movements in apparent retention rates. These populations might include smaller jurisdictions, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and subcategories of the non-government affiliation. There are a number of reasons why apparent rates may generate results that differ from actual rates. \nApparent retention rates provide an indicative measure of the number of full-time school students who have stayed in school, as at a designated year and grade of education. It is expressed as a percentage of the respective cohort group that those students would be expected to have come from, assuming an expected rate of progression of one grade per year.\nProvided ARR is a result of calculation of the whole census and is NOT to be re-calculated by average or sum.",

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian child has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student's  choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the student’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

    "description": "The Department measures progress of children and young people as they move from early childhood into their school years, and then into further education and work through the four objectives across this life cycle: achievement, engagement, wellbeing and productivity.\nOn Victorian Student Satisfaction Survey (multiple years), the survey is of students who completed or left training in the previous year. Results have been rearranged to refer to the year of the Survey. Therefore, the 2021 result (latest available) in this dataset is of student training experiences in 2020, based on the 2021 Satisfaction Survey. Due to 2 changes in the survey methodology, the results for this measure cannot be compared over time. In the 2018 Survey (of 2017 experiences), respondents were given an extra response option in one of the relevant questions. In the 2020 Survey (of 2019 experiences), a further change was made to the job-related benefits question to reduce complexity and confusion.\nOn the Engagement Indicators tab, note that for \"Students with a positive opinion about their school providing a stimulating learning environment\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12). This has been corrected in this Annual Report.\nOn the Wellbeing Indicators tab, note that for \"Students feeling connected to their school\", in 2020–21, the results were reported against the wrong year levels (Years 7–10 and Years 11–12, instead of Year 7-9 and Years 10-12).

    "description": "All designated neighbourhood government schools (referred to as a local school) have a school zone. This does not include schools with specific enrolment criteria including English language schools, selective entry high schools, or community schools. Specialist schools also do not have school zones and have special enrolment criteria.\nEvery Victorian child has the legislated right to enrol at their local government school. A school zone does not restrict a student's  choice to seek enrolment at other government schools. Students can enrol at a school outside their zone if the school has sufficient accommodation and it aligns with the school’s enrolment management implementation plan, where applicable.\nFor students residing in metropolitan Melbourne, Ballarat, Bendigo or Geelong, the local school is usually the nearest government school in a straight line from the student’s permanent residential address. In any other area of Victoria, it is usually the nearest school by the shortest practical route, recognising the additional travel distances often experienced in regional settings.\nIt is recognised that some school zones need to be aligned with geographical and structural barriers that significantly impede direct school access such as rivers and freeways. A main road with pedestrian crossings, however, is not usually considered to be a barrier to accessing a school.\nSchool zones are reviewed annually and may be adjusted to reflect new schools opening, changing provision at existing schools (e.g., relocating a campus or changing year levels offered), improving school accessibility, or managing enrolment demand.\nThe school zones ZIP file consists of distinct spatial datasets for primary school zones and school zones for each year of secondary school, acknowledging the different year levels offered by schools. The spatial datasets can be used in conjunction with the school locations CSV file also available on data.vic.gov.au. School zones have been published on the findmyschool.vic.gov.au website. More information on Victorian school zones can found at https://www.vic.gov.au/school-zones.\nSchool zones have been produced in GDA94 VicGrid projection (EPSG: 3111) using locations that represent the front of the school or driveway access. The location point for all government schools is taken from the department’s register of school locations. Voronoi polygons define the measure of straight-line distance and road classes 0 to 7 in the VicMap Roads dataset have been used to define the measure of shortest practical route. \nThe Victorian government school zones are intended to be relied on by parents and families for the purposes of making enrolment decisions for their children. They should not be relied on for making property purchase decisions, or by any party other than parents and families seeking to enrol their child in a government school.",

In taking a longitudinal view of Australians, the ACLD may uncover new insights into the dynamics and transitions that drive social and economic change over time, conveying how these vary for diverse population groups and geographies. It is envisaged that the 2016 and successive Censuses will be added in the future, as well as administrative data sets. The ACLD is released in ABS TableBuilder and as a microdata product in the ABS Data Laboratory. \r\n\r\n The Census of Population and Housing is conducted every five years and aims to measure accurately the number of people and dwellings in Australia on Census Night. \r\n\r\n Microdata products are the most detailed information available from a Census or survey and are generally the responses to individual questions on the questionnaire. They also include derived data from answers to two or more questions and are released with the approval of the Australian Statistician.\r\nThe following microdata products are available for this longitudinal dataset: \r\n•ACLD in TableBuilder - an online tool for creating tables and graphs. \r\n•ACLD in ABS Data Laboratory (ABSDL) - for in-depth analysis using a range of statistical software packages.\r\n\r\n",
